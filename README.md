# Fragment Words App

## Overview
A simple android app that gives a random list of word starting with a letter as selected by the user. Furthermore, users have the ability to search for a word they click on on their web browser. This is a continuation of [words-app](https://github.com/leoemaxie/words-app) using Fragments instead of Activities.

## What I learnt
* Using Fragments instead of Activities.
* Writing adapters for Fragments and RecyclerView.
* Using Navigation and ensuring safety through safeargs.
* Navigating between different fragments.
* Customizing the menu.

## Building the App
This project was built using gradle 8.1.* and JVM 11.
